Every year, when we are organizing UbuCon Asia, We usually try to provide some travel grant to select beneficiery. Of course, We do also acceptes applications this year.
We're closing travel grant applications a bit earlier this year. **The deadline is April 28th.** If you plan to attend UbuCon Asia this year, but need travel funding support from the committee as you can't really raise travel funding by yourself or through your employer, college or other organizations, please don't forget to apply on-time.

For those who submitted session proposals, We see many people said "Yes" to "Do you need travel grant from the UbuCon Asia committee?" question, but still have not submitted application for travel grant. Please note that travel grant in our conference is separate process from CFP. If you don't apply for travel grant, you won't receive any travel funding from the committee even if you're session proposal has been accepted.

To apply for the travel grant, please head over to the link below then follow the guidance.

Note that any applications submitted after the deadline or not followed the guidance described on our documentations will be considered as invalid.

# Make sure to check other ways to raise funding for your travel

We also remind you that our budget allocated for travel grant is always very limited. Which means, we will be difficult to approve every applications we received and might also approve partial amount which is less then your requested amount. Thus, We encourage you to fund your travel in other ways such as but not limited to:

- Travels of Canonical speakers are expected to be sponsored by Canonical
- For Ubuntu Members, Consider applying for Community Donations Funding
- From your employer
- From your school, college or university
- From other institution or organizaitons 
- Self-fund your travel

We plan to provide some options that would be helpful for reducing your travel costs such as partnered accommodations. More informations to be available on our website.
