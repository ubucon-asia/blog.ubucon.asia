# So, What to do now?

If you have submitted session proposal(s), Content team folks are now busy reviewing them. While reviewing your proposal, Our content reviews might have some questions or feedbacks. In that case, they will leave some comments on your proposal and that would send you some email notifications. So, please make sure to check your inbox and don't miss email notifications from Indico! You might also want to check "My abstracts" section of [this page on Indico](https://events.canonical.com/event/127/abstracts/). Clicking your submission item would send you to your proposal detail page which would also show you comments sections on buttom. You'll be able to find comments from our content team folks in case they left some comments.

When you will be receiving acceptance notifications? Our goal this year is to review all proposals by end of this month, then send out acceptance notifications by mid of May. But since we are all doing this on spare time, please understnad that there could be some possible delays.

# See you all in Kathmandu!

Again, thank you all for submitting session proposals this year! And hopefully we can meet you all in Kathmandu!
